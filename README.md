# Atestat

This is my Informatics Certificate (Atestat în Informatică) Project <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tarikul-Islam-Anik/Animated-Fluent-Emojis/master/Emojis/Objects/Alembic.png" alt="Alembic" width="25" height="25" />, certificate obtained at the end of High School. At first glance, it appears to be a charming online catalog, but it meant a first complex project in my exploration of Computer Science concepts.

Usually, it is an individual project, but me and my friends opted to collaborate as a team to create something more compelling. We decided not to treat this project superficially, but to invest our efforts in creating the most interesting product possible.

I have uploaded the Project Presentation, for a better overview of the product. This presentation is a PDF file detailing the team composition, project overview, database logic, interface screenshots, code snippets, and all the technologies employed (which, at the time, we referred to as "that thing that helps me do this thing") <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tarikul-Islam-Anik/Animated-Fluent-Emojis/master/Emojis/People/Man%20Tipping%20Hand.png" alt="Man Tipping Hand" width="25" height="25" />

If I've piqued your curiosity, I invite you to acquaint yourself with the Electronic Catalog and with Gionut, our mascot. <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tarikul-Islam-Anik/Animated-Fluent-Emojis/master/Emojis/People%20with%20professions/Man%20Student%20Light%20Skin%20Tone.png" alt="Man Student Light Skin Tone" width="25" height="25" />
