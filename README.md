# Atestat

This is my Computer Science Certificate (Atestat în Informatică) project, certificate obtained at the end of High School. At first glance, it appears to be a charming online catalog, but it meant a first complex project in my exploration of Computer Science concepts.

Usually, it is an individual project, but me and my friends opted ti collaborate as a team to create something more compelling.

Unfortunately, we only found CSS and HTML files, we lost all PHP files. HOWEVER, i have uploaded the Project Presentation, for a better overview of the product. This presentation is a PDF file detailing the team composition, project overview, database logi, interface screenshots, code snippets, and all the technologies employed (which, at the time, we reffered to as "that thing that helps me do this thing")
